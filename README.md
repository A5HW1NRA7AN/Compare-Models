🧠 Comparative Analysis of Foundation and Domain-Specific Language Models
📌 Project Overview
This project implements a comparative analysis between one foundation model (e.g., GPT, BERT, T5) and two domain-specific transformer-based models (e.g., FinBERT, BioGPT, Legal-BERT, etc.) across tasks relevant to specialized fields such as finance, healthcare, and legal domains.

The aim is to:

Understand the role and performance of domain-specific models.

Highlight differences in accuracy, relevance, and coherence when compared to general-purpose foundation models.

Use benchmark datasets or synthetic samples for evaluation.

📚 Models Used
Foundation Model:

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

Domain-Specific Models:

FinBERT – Tuned for financial sentiment analysis.

BioGPT – Specialized for biomedical question answering and generation.

🗂️ Dataset & Preprocessing
🧾 Dataset Sources
Finance: Financial PhraseBank (or synthetic finance Q&A dataset)

Healthcare: BioASQ dataset (or synthetic biomedical prompts)

🛠 Preprocessing Steps
Tokenization using the respective model tokenizer.

Truncation and padding to standardize input lengths.

Prompt formatting for consistent task framing (e.g., summarization, Q&A).

Conversion to model-compatible tensor inputs using PyTorch/TensorFlow.

📈 Evaluation Strategy
✅ Output Tasks
Each model was tasked with:

Sentiment classification (Finance)

Biomedical question answering (Healthcare)

Short summary generation (General test prompt)

📊 Evaluation Metrics
BLEU / ROUGE: For generative task quality.

Human Evaluation: Assessed on:

Coherence

Relevance

Factual Accuracy

📷 Outputs and Visualizations
Task	Foundation Model Output	Domain Model Output	Notes
Sentiment Classification	"Neutral"	"Positive" (FinBERT)	FinBERT better understands financial jargon
QA – Biomedical	Low confidence, vague answer	Precise answer with citations (BioGPT)	BioGPT showed domain strength
Summarization	Generic summary	NA	Used only in foundation model comparison

Visuals such as heatmaps, bar charts, and output logs can be added here.

🔍 Comparative Insights
Criteria	BERT	FinBERT	BioGPT
Domain Understanding	❌	✅	✅
Accuracy	Moderate	High	High
Generalization	✅	❌	❌
Speed	✅	✅	Moderate
Vocabulary Fit	❌	✅	✅

🧾 Conclusion
Domain-specific models significantly outperform general-purpose models in specialized tasks.

Foundation models still offer versatility but may lack precision in technical domains.

A hybrid approach (foundation + fine-tuning) could offer best of both worlds.
